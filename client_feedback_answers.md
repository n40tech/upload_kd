Hi [Client Name],

Thank you so much for this detailed feedback! This is incredibly helpful, and I'm glad you're loving the tool.

I've just rolled out an update that directly addresses your points about the gallery, captions, and the disappearing featured image.

Here are some answers to your questions and notes on the changes:

1. Gallery (multi-select) & Captions

"Sometimes I can upload eg 36 images..."

FIXED: This was a bug in how the form handled file selections. It should now work as you expect. You can select a batch of images, and then select more images, and the new ones will be added to the list instead of replacing the old ones.

"Please make this multiple image option easier"

IMPROVED: The gallery uploader now shows a preview for every image you add.

"Could you make it possible to put captions on photos?"

DONE! You will now see a small text box under each image preview in the gallery. Anything you type in there will be saved as that photo's caption in the WordPress Media Library.

2. "Featured image disappears"

FIXED: I've changed the way the form "remembers" your featured image. It should no longer disappear while you're typing in other fields. The file you select will stay selected until you either click "Clear" or submit the post.

3. "How to edit a text that is already there?"

This tool is designed for creating new posts quickly. It doesn't edit posts that are already on the website.

When you successfully create a post, the tool gives you an "Edit Draft" link. That is the correct way to edit. Clicking that link will take you directly to the post editor in WordPress where you can make any changes you want.

4. "I have made many many drafts: how to post them?"

This is done right inside your WordPress admin dashboard.

Log in to your WordPress site.

In the left-hand menu, go to Posts -> All Posts.

You will see a list of all your posts. Find the one you want to publish (it will be marked as a - Draft).

Hover over its title and click the "Edit" link.

This opens the normal WordPress editor. Make any final changes, and when you're ready, click the blue "Publish" button in the top-right corner.

5. "Tags. Do we need to see them on the page itself?"

You're referring to the little "Existing:" and "New:" text that appears under the Tags box, right?

That's a helper feature I added. It checks the tags you're typing against all the tags that already exist on the website. It's just there to help you avoid creating duplicate tags (e.g., "sculpture" vs "Sculptures").

It does not appear on the public website, it's only visible to you inside this form.

Question for you: Do you find it useful, or is it distracting? I can easily remove it if you don't like it.

Let me know what you think of the new changes!

Best,
Nathan
